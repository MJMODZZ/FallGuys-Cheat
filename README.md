# FallGuys-Cheat
<h1 align="center">Welcome to MJMODS.CC Open source FallGuys Cheat with ImGui UI üëã</h1>

## IMPORTANT:
* There is missing a file called `il2cpp.h`, I couldnt upload it because its bigger than 25 Megabytes and I can only opload files up to 25 Megabytes. 
I have uploaded this file on Workupload, here is the [Download](https://workupload.com/file/bxEv5k46mXt). You just have to put this file into the [FG Internal](https://github.com/MJMODZZ/FallGuys-Cheat/tree/main/src/FG%20Internal) And start the Project. This should work

```
1. Download the Reposetory
2. Unzip the ZIP Folder
3. Open [FallGuysInternal.sln](https://github.com/MJMODZZ/FallGuys-Cheat/blob/main/src/FallGuysInternal.sln)
4. Build the DLL as **Release | x64**
5. Inject the DLL with a Working injecor into FallGuys

IMPORTANT:
Make sure the required C++ Packages are installed
```
